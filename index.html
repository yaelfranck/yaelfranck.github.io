          <h1>Digital Futures</h1>
          As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
          the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
          Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
          interacting with digital technology. Friction is resistance. It
          derives from physical interaction between humans, and humans and
          things. Its reach is holistic. <br><br>All senses, elements and emotions play
          a role:
          <span class="sense sense1">sight</span>, 
          <span class="sense sense2">sound</span>, 
          <span class="sense sense3">smell</span>, 
          <span class="sense sense4">taste</span>, 
          <span class="sense sense5">touch</span>,

          <span class="sense sense11">joy</span>, 
          <span class="sense sense12">sadness</span>.
       With movement comes friction.

        ingredient that makes up our humanness and sparks human connection.

          Digital technology has long pursued the goal of eliminating friction,

          innovation replaces a previously friction-laden human interaction

          interactions with fellow humans.

          desire; it allows boredom and allows for a slower pace.
