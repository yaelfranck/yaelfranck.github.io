          As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
          the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
          Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
          interacting with digital technology. Friction is resistance. It
          derives from physical interaction between humans, and humans and
          things. Its reach is holistic. All senses, elements and emotions play
          a role: sight, sound, smell, taste touch, air, earth, temperature,
          agitation, passion, joy, sadness. With movement comes friction.

        Friction, in this context, is not synonymous with either anger or
        conflict, nor is it malfunctioning technology. Friction is an essential

          Digital technology turns our interactions with things into
          interactions with devices. A thing is split into its object, or form,
          and its function. A device is the same object for each function.

          Instead of using our whole hand to interact, we now often use our
          fingertips to swipe screens or interact with air. Each new app or
          innovation replaces a previously friction-laden human interaction
          process. Transactions with machines are perceived to be smoother than
          interactions with fellow humans.

          Everything can be effortlessly and immediately accessed from behind
          our screens. We stay home due to home-delivery, dating apps, online
          classes and endless on-demand entertainment. We are facing 'death by
          convenience'. In such a reality, movement is trimmed down to a
          minimum. In this reality, data is king. In creating convenience, all
          our actions are recorded and translated into data, rendering them
          readable and predictable. The better the data, the better the
          predictability.

      with all senses, all elements, all emotions. It should create situations
      that are not predicted, measured and calculated beforehand; situations

      Friction makes things slower and that is okay. The fastest response might

      This results in the loss of desire, waiting and boredom. Avoiding boredom
      makes us pick up a device as soon as we have nothing to do. Being bored
      lets you start new fascinations. Boredom gets us into productive flow.
      When friction acts to slow things down it allows us to step into the now.
      Designing friction is fuelling longing and desire; it allows boredom and
      allows for a slower pace.

      Smoothness doesn't injure. It doesn't produce resistance. It enforces the
      Like. These mechanisms feed our desire for attention and being seen.
      Designing friction cherishes the non-positive, the 'digital unseen', the
      disagreement, the doubt, the vulnerable, the complicated. This is what
