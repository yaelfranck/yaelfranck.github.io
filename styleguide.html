        As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
        the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
        Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
        interacting with digital technology.

    <div class="body funky pink medium mb width50 mlauto">
      The more we move and act, the more friction we encounter. The more
      friction there is, the more we engage and care. Friction drives our
      engagement. Friction, in this context, is not synonymous with either anger
      or conflict, nor is it malfunctioning technology. Friction is an essential
      ingredient that makes up our humanness and sparks human connection.

      **Friction is a lively intrinsic experience
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="body blue mb width25 mrauto">
        Digital technology has long pursued the goal of eliminating friction,
        striving for seamlessness. We now navigate a sea of frictionless
        experiences.
      </div>
      <div class="body mb width50 mlauto">
        Digital techology goes hand in hand with the loss of physical
        resistance. Digital technology turns our interactions with things into
        interactions with devices. A thing is SPLIT into its object, or form and
        its function. A device is the same object for each function. It's your
        purse, your musical instrument and your letterbox, each of which now
        demands the same bodily action. Instead of using our whole hand to
        interact, we now often use our fingertips to swipe screens or interact
        with air. Each new app or innovation replaces a previously fricion-laden
        human interaction process.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="body mb width50 mlauto">
      Transactions with machines are percieved to be smoother than interactions
      with fellow humans. Everything can be effortlessly accessed from behind
      our screens. We stay home due to home delivery, dating apps, online
      classes and endless on-demand entertainment. We are facing 'death by
      convenience.' In such a reality, movement is trimmed down to a minimum.In
      this reality, DATA IS KING. In creating convenience, all our actions are
      recorded and translated into data, rendering them readable and
      predictable. The better the data,

    <div class="body mb width75 mlauto">
      keeping friction out maintains a fragile equilibrium. ENTER AI...
      Technology becomes omnipresent, and evolves from being a tool, to being a
      companion with humanlike appeal. We are on the verge of committing our
      emotions to AI, plunging into an emotional dependancy.
    </div>

    <div class="body mb width75 mlauto">AI indulges us,</div>

    <div class="body extralarge mb">CONSUMES US.</div>

    <div class="body mb width75 mlauto">
      Its appeal gives us the comforts and conveniences we learn to seek. To get
      satisfaction from interaction with a model, you need to perform your
      predictable self. It becomes almost impossible to step out, to live
      FRICTIONFULLY!
    </div>

    <div class="body extralarge mb">OUR AUTONOMY IS AT STAKE.</div>

    <div class="body mb width75 mrauto">
      Complete removal of friction means standing still. A completely
      predictable future is no future, but a continuous present. In a world
      where even our deepest desires can be foreseen, where we have lost our
      autonomy, we long for what remains beyond the domain of data, algorithms
      and databases and AI.
    </div>

    <div class="body blue mb width75 mlauto">
      A world headed for a frictionless reality begs the question: how can we
      create a desirable future with digital technology? How can we access,
      develop and relate to it?
    </div>

    <div class="aqua funky large bgpink width75 yss">
      We like to see designing friction as a fundamental design principle when
      working with digital culture. Instead of following design ethics that
      strive to ELIMINATE friction, we suggest not only to allow, but EMBRACE
      friction!
    </div>

    <div class="pink funky large width75 mb">
      To facilitate it: design products with digital technology in a way that
      makes space for our humanness. Here friction is a core ingredient. Digital
      technology should create environments and situations in which we can truly
      connect with each other,
    </div>

        as well as with the unknown, the uncontrolled, with all senses, all

      <div class="blue medium width50 mlauto">
        It should create situations that are not predicted, measured and

      With friction we get immersed, we get creative, we get alive. Discomfort
      allows us to experience boundaries both physically and mentally. These are
      necessary and productive.

    <div class="title yellow strokethick mblarge">
      Designing friction is exploring boundaries.
    </div>

    <div class="funky pink medium mblarge center mcenter width50">
      Friction makes things slower and that is okay. The fastest response might
      not be the best one to design for. Instant gratification is what digital
      technology currently optimizes for.
    </div>

    <div class="body mb width75 mlauto">
      This results in the loss of desire, waiting and boredom. Avoiding boredom
      makes us pick up a device as soon as we have nothing to do.
    </div>

    <div class="funky large aqua bs width25 mrauto">
      Being bored lets you start new fascinations. Boredom gets us into
      productive flow. When friction acts to slow things down it allows us to
      step into the NOW!
    </div>

    <div class="funky large aqua bs width25 mlauto mblarge">
      Designing friction is fuelling longing and desire; it allows boredom and
      allows for a slower pace...
    </div>

    <div class="body width75 mlauto mblarge">
      When interacting with screens we lack resistance. Swiping screens makes
      our world more superficial. Human life gains depth when having
      thing-relations. Thing-relations tend to bring us together physically and
      create connections.

    <div class="funky pink extralarge mb underline">
      Designing friction requires thinking about how to increase our resistance.

      Acknowledge the fulfilment in the non-positive. Today's digital technology
      creates a society that is in 'pursuit of happiness', in awe of positivity.
      Smoothness doesn't injure. It doesn't produce resistance. It enforces the
      Like. These mechanisms feed our desire for attention and being seen.
