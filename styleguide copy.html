          As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
          the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
          Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
          interacting with digital technology. Friction is resistance. It
          derives from physical interaction between humans, and humans and
          things. Its reach is holistic.

            All senses, elements and emotions play a role: sight, sound, smell,
            taste touch, air, earth, temperature, agitation, passion, joy,
            sadness. With movement comes friction.

        Friction, in this context, is not synonymous with either anger or
        conflict, nor is it malfunctioning technology. Friction is an essential
        ingredient that makes up our humanness and sparks human connection.

        Instead of using our whole hand to interact, we now often use our
        fingertips to swipe screens or interact with air. Each new app or
        innovation replaces a previously friction-laden human interaction
        process. Transactions with machines are perceived to be smoother than
        interactions with fellow humans.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything can be effortlessly and immediately accessed from behind our
        screens. We stay home due to home-delivery, dating apps, online classes
        and endless on-demand entertainment.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are facing 'death by convenience'. In such a reality, movement is
        trimmed down to a minimum. In this reality, data is king. In creating
        convenience, all our actions are recorded and translated into data,
        rendering them readable and predictable. The better the data, the better
        the predictability.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unpredictability, human messiness and unforeseen actions are all
        friction, and counter this goal. Predictable futures can be controlled.

          Keeping friction out maintains a fragile equilibrium. Enter AI â€”
          technology becomes omnipresent, and evolves from being a tool, to
          being a companion with humanlike appeal. We are on the verge of
          committing our emotions to AI, plunging into an emotional dependency.

        <div class="body mb width50 mlauto mrlarge">
          AI indulges us, consumes us. Its appeal gives us the comforts and
          conveniences we learn to seek. To get satisfaction from interaction
          with a model, you need to perform your predictable self. It becomes
          almost impossible to step out, to live frictionfully. Our autonomy is
          at stake.

        Complete removal of friction means standing still. A completely
        predictable future is no future, but a continuous present. In a world
        where even our deepest desires can be foreseen, where we have lost our
        autonomy, we long for what remains beyond the domain of data, algorithms
        and databases and AI.

      We like to see designing friction as a fundamental design principle when

    <div class="funky large blue mb mcenter width75 center">
      To facilitate it: design products with digital technology in a way that
      makes space for our humanness. Here friction is a core ingredient. Digital
      technology should create environments and situations in which we can truly
      connect with each other, as well as with the unknown, the uncontrolled,
      with all senses, all elements, all emotions. It should create situations
      that are not predicted, measured and calculated beforehand; situations
      that result from and amount to the present moment.
