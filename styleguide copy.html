        As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
        the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
        Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
        interacting with digital technology. Friction is resistance. It derives
        from physical interaction between humans, and humans and things. Its
        reach is holistic.

        All senses, elements and emotions play a role: sight, sound, smell,

        Friction, in this context, is not synonymous with either anger or
        conflict, nor is it malfunctioning technology. Friction is an essential
        ingredient that makes up our humanness and sparks human connection.

        Digital technology goes hand-in-hand with the loss of physical

        In this reality, data is king. In creating convenience, all our actions

        Keeping friction out maintains a fragile equilibrium. Enter AI â€”
        technology becomes omnipresent, and evolves from being a tool, to being
        a companion with humanlike appeal. We are on the verge of committing our
        emotions to AI, plunging into an emotional dependency.

        AI indulges us, consumes us. Its appeal gives us the comforts and
        conveniences we learn to seek. To get satisfaction from interaction with
        a model, you need to perform your predictable self. It becomes almost
        impossible to step out, to live frictionfully. Our autonomy is at stake.

        Complete removal of friction means standing still. A completely
        predictable future is no future, but a continuous present. In a world
        where even our deepest desires can be foreseen, where we have lost our
        autonomy, we long for what remains beyond the domain of data, algorithms
        and databases and AI.

    <div class="funky large blue mblarge">
      We like to see designing friction as a fundamental design principle when
      working with digital culture. Instead of following design ethics that
      strive to eliminate friction, we suggest to not only allow, but
    </div>

    <div class="funky extralarge yellow pcard center">EMBRACE FRICTION!</div>

    To facilitate it: design products with digital technology in a way that
    makes space for our humanness. Here friction is a core ingredient. Digital
    technology should create environments and situations in which we can truly
    connect with each other, as well as with the unknown, the uncontrolled, with
    all senses, all elements, all emotions. It should create situations that are
    not predicted, measured and calculated beforehand; situations that result
    from and amount to the present moment.
