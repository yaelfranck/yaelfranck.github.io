          <h1>Digital Futures</h1>
          As designers, entrepreneurs and architects of digital culture we feel
          the urge to refocus how we deal with our digital futures. Designing
          Friction is a proposal to change the way we think when producing or
          interacting with digital technology. Friction is resistance. It
          derives from physical interaction between humans, and humans and
          things. Its reach is holistic. All senses, elements and emotions play
          a role: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, air, earth, temperature,
          agitation, passion, joy, sadness. With movement comes friction.

        (The more we move and act, the more friction we encounter. The more
        friction there is, the more we engage and care.) Friction drives our
        engagement.

        Friction, in this context, is not synonymous with either anger or
        conflict, nor is it malfunctioning technology. Friction is an essential
        ingredient that makes up our humanness and sparks human connection.

          Instead of using our whole hand to interact, we now often use our
          fingertips to swipe screens or interact with air. Each new app or
          innovation replaces a previously friction-laden human interaction
          process. Transactions with machines are perceived to be smoother than
          interactions with fellow humans.

          <h1>In praise of boredom</h1>
          Avoiding boredom makes us pick up a device as soon as we have nothing
          to do. Being bored lets you start new fascinations. Boredom gets us
          into productive flow. When friction acts to slow things down it allows
          us to step into the now. Designing friction is fuelling longing and
          desire; it allows boredom and allows for a slower pace.
